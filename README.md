# Todolist project
project bootstrapped with reactjs

in this project i was able to create a todolist that is fully manipulatable, no backups to memory are added and am fully aware of that loophole,
it has helped me solify my knowledge on state management and others.

## corrections and notice to better practices will be greatle appreciated.
project still by chinedu Matthew
